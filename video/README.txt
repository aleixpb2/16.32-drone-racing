To generate the video, ROS and Gazebo should be installed and the Python script needs to be run inside a ROS package. I used an internal package from my lab, the Aerospace Controls Laboratory, but any other should work. 
The quadrotor model used, called quadrotor_static, was also obtained from the ACL.
